            I’m a Computer Science major with a concentration in Information 
            Technology at the University of North Carolina Charlotte. I aspire to become a cloud/software
            developer. I use Java and Python the most, but I’m looking forward to learning more languages

        <h3>Personal Background</h3>
        <p>
            I was born in Haiti, but have lived in Charlotte basically my whole life.

        <h3>Professional Background</h3>
        <p>
            I don't have much technical experience besides working on personal projects,but I've been working at Harris teeter for the past two year.
            Which help me improve my communication skills and teamwork skills.

        <h3>Academic Background</h3>
        <p>
            I transferred from CPCC(central piedmont community collage) with an associate in arts degree. My major at UNCC Charlotte
            is computer science with a concentration in information technology. I'm currently classified as a sophomore.
