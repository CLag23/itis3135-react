            <h2>Contract</h2>
            <p>
                I, Carls Laguerre agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my FALL 2025, FRONT-END-WEB APP DEVELOPMENT, ITIS3135 with my instructor, 
                Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, 
                and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it 
                is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.
            </p>
            <p>
                As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. 
                I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. 
                I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit 
                (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. Signed: Carls Laguerre, 09/01/2025
